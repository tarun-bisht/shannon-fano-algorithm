# shennon_fennon-commpression
This is implementation code for shanon_fennon encoding which is used for compressing data. The code works using the principles of shannon_fennon compression encoding. It uses probability based technique to find occurrence of each character in string and then encoding the most occurrence character to represent it with less number of bits.
